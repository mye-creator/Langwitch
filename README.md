Hi! This is my first programming language I ever made. I am not pro at it, but I hope you will enjoy it!
<h1>How to install</h1>
Online Compiler : *(coming soon)*
Manually: Okay, so we need:
* Console
* Installed Node.js LTS version
* Folder of the language
* Your Text Editor
You need to clone into this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/mye-creator/Langwitch.git```
Check if node installed or not:
```node -v```
If everything is good, then use 'cd' command to go to the another folder. Just go to your folder where our language is. (Langwitch/compiler/):
```cd folder where language is/Langwitch/compiler```
If you are in different folder, type ``cd ../`` to go back to the previous folder.
<br>
Open your text editor and then open the language folder.
If you are done, go to test.lw file and manipulate with it.
**DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN OTHER FILES, THEY ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE MAKING THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WORKING!!!**
You can learn language by examples there: *(coming soon)*

The tutorial is ended, please contact this mail for questions: **langwitch@gmail.com**
